## How does it work?

Our project collect data from Carla Simulator as a virtual world and car. Using ROS connections, GNSS data comes from the virtual car into our database. Of course we keep your data to not to be tracked by other user or companies. After we get your data safely, we analyze it and first show it to your front-end application. (in Web/App) Basically you can access to your driving history, driving analysis (such as speed over, ...). We will let you see your personalized insurace based on your driving history, and only final insurance product will be shared with insurance companies. You can manage the insurances in our application too.
